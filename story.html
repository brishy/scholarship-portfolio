								<h1>My story</h1>
								<p>Empowering Underprivileged Communities through Education</p>
							</header>
							<a href="#" class="image main"><img src="images/slides/slide01.jpg" alt="" /></a>
							<p> I graduated from a High School for Gifted Students with a burning passion for teaching and learning English. I had
							always dreamed of becoming a teacher, but I never imagined that my love for English would lead me to the world of web
							development.
							</br> </br>
							After graduation, I stumbled upon an opportunity to learn full stack web development for free at #100devs agency, a
							non-profit organization that helps people from underprivileged backgrounds learn coding skills. I jumped at the chance
							and dove headfirst into the world of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other web development technologies. I was amazed at how
							much I could do with these new tools and I knew that my career path was set.
							</br> </br>
							As I learned more and more, I realized that my passion for teaching and learning English could be combined with my
							newfound skills in web development to make a real impact in the world. I decided to use my knowledge to teach English
							and coding for free to folks that can't afford it, especially those living in mountainous areas. I wanted to empower
							individuals with the skills and knowledge they need to succeed in today's digital world. I knew that by providing these
							skills for free, I could truly make a difference.
							</br> </br>
							I reached out to several non-profit organizations that were working in the mountainous areas, and they welcomed me with
							open arms. I was able to teach English and coding to children, teenagers, and adults who had never had the opportunity
							to learn these skills before. Seeing the progress they made, the way they understood and applied the knowledge and the
							impact it was having on their lives was truly an incredible experience.
							
							Not only was I able to empower these individuals with the skills they need to succeed in the modern world, but I was
							also able to make a real difference in their communities. Many of my students were able to find better jobs and improve
							their standard of living, and some even started their own businesses. It was a fulfilling experience, and I am forever
							grateful for the opportunity to make a difference in the world through teaching and learning.</p>
